# theresewng.github.io - This file should explain the purpose of the website, including what technologies are used and how the site can be navigated.

This is my website for IAT 355, which will host a bunch of visualisations that I will be making for the Fall 2025 term. This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will integrate graphs created also with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This site can be navigated via the pill-shaped navigation bar at the bottom of your screen, or a hamburger menu located at the top of your screen if you are on mobile/small devices
