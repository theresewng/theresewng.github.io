    <h2 class="h2-title">First, A Look At The Data</h2>
    <p>Action is the most popular genre, with 13,004 games available and Puzzle being the least popular with 2280
        available games. This gives us a very large range of 10,724, a median of 4,998, and a mean of 5,430.33.</p>

    <p>I am not surprised that Puzzle is the least popular genre. I feel like the last puzzle game I ever played was
        <i>Unblock Me</i> on the iPad 2 (2011)! I personally don't like playing action games (I wasn't allowed to play
        violent games growing up), but I am not surprised by its popularity, especially when you have memes such as
        <i>We got XYZ before GTA 6!</i>
    </p>

    <p>I was surprised by the popularity of the Sports games genre. However, I believe that within the next few years,
        other genres, especially role playing and simulation games, will surpass the Sports genre. It seems
        unsustainable how every year there is a new NBA or Madden NFL game that costs $60, with roughly the same
        gameplay, just different music.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

    <p>To create this visualisation, I used a bar graph to quickly compare and effectively communicate the data between
        platforms easily. To further breakdown the information, I colour coded the genres so understand what are the
        most popular genres within each plaform. Looking at the graph above, action games are quite prominent across the
        board, though other genres, such as sports, being a popular genre for platforms such as PlayStation, Wii, and
        XBox360 also doesn't surprise me as it shows the trends within the gaming community around the times these
        platforms were at its popularity.</p>

    <p>According to the data, DS is the most popular platform with [x], with the PS2 coming in just under at [x], a mere
        difference of [x] sales. Given that data is from 2020, I wonder how this graph would look with the inclusion of
        the Nintendo Switch compared to the DS, and with the Wii and Wii U not in production / very few modern day TVs
        able to support the Wii's resolution/necessary inputs.</p>

    <p>I am not surprised by the high popularity for PlayStation platforms as while PlayStations and XBox have
        relatively similar performance, its partnership with Microsoft has been... interesting, with have critics
        calling the XBox360 the last best console released.</p>

    <p>2009 had the most sales with [x] number of games sold, with 2008 being the second most popular year with [x]
        amount of games sold. Both years, DS was the most popular platform</p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>
    <p>Overall, the PS2 was the most popular platform internationally, with North America being its major supporter.
        Overall for the most part, North Americans bought the most video game platforms, with the exception of the PS4
        and PC, of which were more popular within the European population, and the Nintendo 3DS and SNES being more
        popular amongst Japanese people.</p>

    <p>However, in my opinion, this graph is a bit more biased against Japanese people as they are roughly a fifth the
        size of North America's population and a seventh of Europe, resulting in them having "the least sales" compared
        to other regions. I wonder how visualisation would look if we included more of the Asian population. That being
        said, their support for Nintendo products is relatively strong.</p>
