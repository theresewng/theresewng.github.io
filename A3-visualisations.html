    <h2 class="h2-title">First, A Look At The Data</h2>
    <p>Action is the most popular genre, with 13.004 million games sold and Puzzle being the least popular with 2.280
        million
        games sold. This gives us a very large range of 10.724 million, a median of 4.998 million, and a mean of 5.430
        million.</p>

            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@886.js?v=4";

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

    <p>To create this visualisation, I used a bar graph to quickly compare and effectively communicate the data between
        platforms easily.</p>

    <p>According to the data, DS is the most popular platform with 8.524 million sales, with the PS2 coming in just
        under at 8.508 million, a mere difference of 0.016 million or 0.1% in sales. Given that data is from 2020, I
        wonder how this graph would look with the inclusion of the Nintendo Switch, which ultimately took over for the
        DS.</p>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@5/dist/inspector.css">
        <script type="module">
            import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@5/dist/runtime.js";
            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@886.js?v=4";
            new Runtime().module(define, name => {
                if (name === "GlobalSalesGenrePlatform") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-GlobalSalesGenrePlatform-f21471f5"));
            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h2>

    <p>To experiment with how I can storytell with Obsevable, I created this whimsy graph showing sales of each
        platforms using an area chart and sales of the genre using shapes.</p>
    <div id="visualisations-container">
        <div id="observablehq-SalesPlatformGenre-46acba26"></div>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@5/dist/inspector.css">
        <script type="module">
            import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@5/dist/runtime.js";
            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@1224.js?v=4";
            new Runtime().module(define, name => {
                if (name === "SalesPlatformGenre") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-SalesPlatformGenre-46acba26"));
            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <p>That being said, this might not be the most accessible way to read data, so I also split the data into two
        separate graphs. I used a line graph to show the genre sales over time to understand the continuous ups and
        downs of sales in a continuous sales over the years, and a point and colour graph to see the platform sales as
        there are a lot of various platforms and I noticed that the standard colour palette was quite limited,
        therefore, by using both shape and colour, I can get a better understanding of what is what </p>

    <p>2009 was a popular year for action games, with 1.088 million games sold. On the other hand, platform games were
        the least popular with 116 million platform games sold. While on one hand, I find it strange that 2009 sold less
        games than 2008, I believe it might be because of Christmas/Birthday gifts following the surge in sales the year
        prior. </p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>

    <p>For this visualisation, I created a group bar chart as I wanted to easily compare sales across regions per
        platform instead of creating separate graphs. </p>

    <p>Overall, the most popular platforms across the globe were the PS2 and the XBox360, with North America being its
        major supporter.</p>

    <p>In order, Europe's most popular platforms are the PS3, PS2, and the XBox360</p>
    <p>North Americans mostly bought the XBox360, PS2, and the Wii</p>
    <p>Japan's most popular platforms were the DS, PS, and the PS2</p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 4: The Top Ten Publishers</h2>
    <h3>4.1: Who Are the Top Ten Publishers? How Many Games Did They Sell?</h3>

    <p> [why bar chart] Electronic Arts dominates the market with 5.356 million games. Take-Two Interactive has the
        least number of sales with 1.648 million games. That is a range of 3.708 million games. This gives us an average
        of 3.243 million games per publisher and a median of 3.070 million.

        Of the games, Electronic Arts creates mostly sports games, at 2.216 million total games, which make sense
        because they are the ones behind Madden NFL, NHL Games, and FIFA. Konami created the second most amount of
        sports games at 1.116 million games. Puzzle was the least popular genre with 796 million games sold, with
        Nintendo producing the most puzzle games out of the ten, which I can understand since their platforms such as
        Wii is made with co-op playing in mind.</p>

            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <h3>4.2: What Platform Are Their Customers Mainly Using?</h3>

    <p> [why cell chart] ]I think what makes this interesting to look at, is that 4 of the top ten largest publishers
        are Japanese-based companies. A country is a fifth of the North American population is creating roughly 40% of
        all the games that everyday people are playing, showing the impressive reach and influence they have on other
        consumers.</p>

            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <h3>4.3: What Were Their Top Five Selling Games?</h3>

    <p> [why this chart] The fact that Nintendo has the most total sales even though they overall did not produce that
        many games is wild to me, especially when we put it up against the games created by Electronic Arts. </p>
