    <h2 class="h2-title">First, A Look At The Data</h2>
    <p>Action is the most popular genre, with 13.004 million games sold and Puzzle being the least popular with 2.280
        million
        games sold. This gives us a very large range of 10.724 million, a median of 4.998 million, and a mean of 5.430
        million.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

    <p>To create this visualisation, I used a bar graph to quickly compare and effectively communicate the data between
        platforms easily.</p>

    <p>According to the data, DS is the most popular platform with 8.524 million sales, with the PS2 coming in just
        under at 8.508 million, a mere difference of 0.016 million or 0.1% in sales. Given that data is from 2020, I
        wonder how this graph would look with the inclusion of the Nintendo Switch, which ultimately took over for the
        DS.</p>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@5/dist/inspector.css">
        <script type="module">
            import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@5/dist/runtime.js";
            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@886.js?v=4";
            new Runtime().module(define, name => {

            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h2>

    <p>To experiment with how I can storytell with Obsevable, I created this whimsy graph showing sales of each
        platforms using an area chart and sales of the genre using shapes.</p>
    <div id="visualisations-container">
        <div id="observablehq-SalesPlatformGenre-46acba26"></div>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@5/dist/inspector.css">
        <script type="module">
            import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@5/dist/runtime.js";
            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@1224.js?v=4";
            new Runtime().module(define, name => {
                if (name === "SalesPlatformGenre") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-SalesPlatformGenre-46acba26"));
            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <p>That being said, this might not be the most accessible way to read data, so I also split the data into two
        separate graphs. Therefore, I split the data into two separate line graphs to show the genre sales over time to understand the continuous ups and downs of sales in a continuous sales over the years, and compare that to the platform sales. </p>

    <p>2009 was a popular year for action games, with 1.088 million games sold. On the other hand, platform games were
        the least popular with 116 million platform games sold. While on one hand, I find it strange that 2009 sold less
        games than 2008, I believe it might be because of Christmas/Birthday gifts following the surge in sales the year
        prior. </p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>

    <p>For this visualisation, I created a group bar chart as I wanted to easily compare sales across regions per
        platform instead of creating separate graphs. </p>

    <p>Overall, the most popular platforms across the globe were the PS2 and the XBox360, with North America being its
        major supporter.</p>

    <p>In order, Europe's most popular platforms are the PS3, PS2, and the XBox360</p>
    <p>North Americans mostly bought the XBox360, PS2, and the Wii</p>
    <p>Japan's most popular platforms were the DS, PS, and the PS2</p>

    <h2 class="h2-title">Visualisation 4: The Top Ten Publishers</h2>
    <h3>4.1: Who Are the Top Ten Publishers? How Many Games Did They Sell?</h3>

    <p>I wanted to see which publishers were leading the gaming industry and creating a bar graph was a quick way to see the data all at once. Electronic Arts dominates this market with about 5.356 million games sold. On the other end, Take-Two Interactive sold the least at 1.648 million, giving a pretty big range of 3.708 million between them. On average, each publisher sold about 3.243 million games, with a median of 3.070 million</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that Electronic Arts dominates sports games when they’re behind titles like Madden NFL, FIFA and NHL. Meanwhile, puzzle games were the least popular, with Nintendo leading that genre, which makes sense since their platforms often have a focus on co-op play.</p>

<p>One thing I notice with this graph is if I am remembering correctly, THQ had to cease operations in 2012, yet they are quite up here in game production. If we look at it from today's POV, would they still be sixth in the market?</p>

            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@1776.js?v=4";
            new Runtime().module(define, name => {

            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <h3>4.2: What Platform Are Their Customers Mainly Using?</h3>

    <p>  I created a cell chart that used a colour gradient to quickly show popularity across the platforms. I think what makes this interesting to look at, is that 4 of the top ten largest publishers
        are Japanese-based companies. A country is a fifth of the North American population is creating roughly 40% of
        all the games that everyday people are playing, with Nintendo having the most sales compared to all the other publishers. This could reflect the impressive reach and influence they have on other consumers.</p>
    <div id="visualisations-container">
        <div id="observablehq-cellChart-46ac659b"></div>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@5/dist/inspector.css">
        <script type="module">
            import { Runtime, Inspector } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@5/dist/runtime.js";
            import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/f9cc6e9dc3d1d7f2@1776.js?v=4";
            new Runtime().module(define, name => {
                if (name === "cellChart") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-cellChart-46ac659b"));
            });
        </script>
    </div>

    <h3>4.3: What Were Their Top Five Selling Games?</h3>

    <p> This sort of grouped cell chart helped to group the publishers together into a singular line while also helping to see how many sales they have. Most of the time, I am unaware of the game publisher, I would have a better knowledge of the game’s name itself. The fact that Nintendo has the most total sales even though they overall did not produce that many games is wild to me, especially when we put it up against the games created by Electronic Arts. </p>

    <p>One theory I have is that because Nintendo is different in the way that they create both platforms and games, most of the games they create is solely for their own products,meaning they have a more focused scope, while other publishers have to cater to a variety of platforms for the sake of reach, which can spread their sales out a bit more.</p>
